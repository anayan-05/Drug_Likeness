# Drug_Likeness
# AI-Powered Drug Discovery
This project applies AI/ML techniques to predict the drug-likeness of molecules using the XGBoost model and **Lipinski's Rule of 5**.

## Key Features:
- SMILES cleaning
- Descriptors calculation using **RDKit**
- Model evaluation with **XGBoost** and **cross-validation**
- 100% accuracy on validation and test sets

## Requirements:
- `xgboost`
- `rdkit`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the ipynb file to start training the model
